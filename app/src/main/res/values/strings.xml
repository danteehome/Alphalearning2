        A is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.[1] It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives.
        The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar.
        The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ.
        The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.
